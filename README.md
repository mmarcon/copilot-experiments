# Copilot Experiments

Most of the code in this repository has been written with/by a code assistant that uses generative AI.

The goal is to understand how helpful tools like [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), etc. are when writing code.

To get a good perspective on this topic I am mostly picking little projects that use APIs I never used, or in areas I never worked before and see how quickly I can get to a simple MVP.
